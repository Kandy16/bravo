1) First question is answered by bravo_assignment5_q1.py. It runs the server and serves the file which is inside 'www' folder - index.html
2) Second and third question are clubbed together and put in bravo_assignment5_q2.py

Right now, it has configured to run with server 141.*.*.*, But when we tried hosting the server, we had some issues and tweak the code.


The code to host the server is bravo_assignment5_host.py.
If the code has to run with local host then we suggest to make changes at two places
Inside the file bravo_assignment5_q2

 splitData = data.split(b'\r\n\r\n') #for actual testing
 #splitData = data.split(b'\n\n',1) # for local instance

Uncomment the second line. Somehow carriage return were getting missed out.


    urlInput='http://141.26.208.82/articles/g/e/r/Germany.html'
    #urlInput = 'http://localhost/articles/g/e/r/Germany.html'

Change the url above.


Happy testing :-)
